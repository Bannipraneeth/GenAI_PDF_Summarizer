‚úçÔ∏è Advanced PDF Summarizer with Gemini
This is a web application built with Streamlit that allows you to summarize PDF documents using Google's Gemini Pro Large Language Model. The app provides a user-friendly interface to upload a PDF, enter a custom prompt, and generate a tailored summary. It also includes advanced controls to fine-tune the summarization process.

‚ú® Features
Upload PDFs: Easily upload any PDF document directly through the web interface.

Custom Prompts: Guide the summarization process with your own specific instructions (e.g., "summarize for a 5th grader," "extract key financial data").

Selectable Summarization Methods:

Stuff: A fast method that processes the entire document in a single call. Best for smaller documents.

MapReduce: A more robust method that handles large documents by summarizing them in chunks.

Dynamic Controls: Use interactive sliders in the sidebar to adjust the chunk_size and chunk_overlap for more granular control over the text splitting process.

Powered by Google Gemini: Leverages the gemini-1.5-flash-latest model for high-quality, context-aware summaries.
